This is supplementary code for the co-location modelling work, for cleaning input data and for plotting energy operation data. 

The file 'dual plot.py' plots two energy operation scenarios side by side.

'plot w price.py' plots one scenario, and energy operation. For this code to work it is essential that the column within the original UI that contains prices is called 'Market_Price', as this is the only column that will join to the operational data. Alternatively, price data can be pasted in to the scenario after running.
